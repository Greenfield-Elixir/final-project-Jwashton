# ShopEx

## The App

ShopEx is your online store's inventory management system. You can view items at `/items` and perform the following actions:

* Add a new item to the store for sale
* Edit an item's name, quantity, price or whether or not it is on sale
* Recall an item, which deletes it from your inventory entirely

## Up and Running

  * Setup the project with `mix setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
