# Services
The Services app is the home for any and all services that might consume and act on messages published by ShopEx. This is where you will define consumers for ShopEx's Inventory messages. For example, maybe the Services app defines a Marketing service with a consumer for "item on sale" messages so that such items can be promoted to customers accordingly.
